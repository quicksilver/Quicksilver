<p><b>Getting Started</b><br>
Invoke Quicksilver using the HotKey you defined. This will bring up a window you can use to search for items and build commands.

<p><b>Finding an item</b><br>
To search, simply type part of an item's name. Quicksilver will match both the beginning of a name as well as abbreviations. If Quicksilver finds multiple files that match, it will show a list of alternatives. Select the correct item using the arrow keys and you will be able to use the abbreviation in the future.

<p><b>Choosing an action (optional)</b><br>
Quicksilver chooses a default action to perform on the item you have selected. If you'd like to explore other options, hit the tab key to move to the action search field. The down arrow will reveal some of the many things you can do.

<p><b>Performing the command</b><br>
Once you have selected an item, hit return to perform it.
