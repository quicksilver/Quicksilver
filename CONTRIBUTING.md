# Issues

If you are having a problem with Quicksilver, before creating an issue please consider checking the following places:

* The [Quicksilver Wiki](http://qsapp.com/wiki) (more importantly the [FAQ](http://qsapp.com/wiki/FAQ))
* Search [previous issues](http://github.com/quicksilver/quicksilver/issues) created on the issue tracker
* Search previous posts on the [Quicksilver Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/blacktree-quicksilver).

If the issue is related to a plugin, be sure to read the plugin documentation. Open a plugin's documentation by selecting it in the [Plugins Preferences](http://qs.qsapp.com/plugins), then clicking the '?' button in the bottom right hand corner (or use the ⌘⌥? shortcut).

Finally, some plugins are currently unsupported. If you have any plugin listed on the [Unsupported Plugins](http://qsapp.com/wiki/Unsupported_Plugins) page installed, then please remove them to see if the problem still exists.
